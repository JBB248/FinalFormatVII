HEY
Thanks for downloading Final Format VII!
This a formatting app that I made to print out a cover for Final Fantasy VII.

Using this app is as simple as finding a box art online, feeding it into this app, setting a box art size, and pressing export!
It will create an image automatically sized to the selected page size, 
so that there's no concern of a printer incorrectly sizing the box art.

This app is free and open source at https://github.com/JBB248/FinalFormatVII. Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
If you paid for this, you probably got scammed! Sorry!

NOTE: If you select to stretch the box art to the desired box size, it may recieve some degredation. Use it at your own risk!
The best strategy is to try and find a box art that's already about the same size, and use this to turn it into a printable page.
If you think that the box art is the correct size, try changing the output dpi. 
The image's original dpi is shown in the log after loading the image.

If you want to make a box art with a reverse side for a transparent box (e.g Switch or PS3),
export the two separately, and make sure that the are exported at the same size. 
FFVII centers box art on the output page, so as long as they are the same size, they will be aligned if printed front and back.

If you find that a cover is printing incorrectly sized, report it here:
